# Contributing to Gratheon

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gratheon! We welcome 
contributions from the community.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your contributions, we require that you sign our 
Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is a standard practice for open 
source projects and helps us maintain clear ownership and licensing of the code.

### Why do we need a CLA?

Gratheon uses a dual-licensing model:
- **AGPL v3** for open source use
- **Commercial License** for enterprise customers

The CLA gives us the rights to:
1. Include your contribution in both the open source and commercial versions
2. Relicense your contribution under different terms if needed
3. Protect the project from legal issues

**Important**: You retain ownership of your contribution and can use it 
however you like. The CLA just gives us permission to use it too.

### How to sign the CLA

We use [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io) to streamline the CLA process:

1. **First-time contributors**: When you submit your first pull request, the 
   CLA Assistant bot will automatically comment and ask you to sign the CLA.

2. **Click the link** in the bot's comment to review and sign the CLA.

3. **Sign digitally** using your GitHub account (takes ~2 minutes).

4. **That's it!** Once signed, you can contribute to any Gratheon repository.

Alternatively, you can:
- Download the [Individual CLA](../templates/CLA-INDIVIDUAL.md)
- Or [Corporate CLA](../templates/CLA-CORPORATE.md) if contributing on behalf 
  of a company
- Sign and email to contributors@gratheon.com

### For Corporate Contributors

If you're contributing as part of your job, your employer needs to sign the 
Corporate CLA. Please have your legal department review and sign the 
[Corporate CLA](../templates/CLA-CORPORATE.md).

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We follow standard open 
source community guidelines.
